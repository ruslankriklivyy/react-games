### This was my first experience using Redux Saga, in this project I relayed the registration through Google and Githab. Here you can view information about any game, add desired games and see what stores are available for the game

### The technologies I used

- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- Redux / Redux Saga
- FireBase
- react-reveal
- styled-components
- react-firebase-hooks
- react-inner-image-zoom
